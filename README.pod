=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::App::Command::dhmakeperl - use dh-make-perl to generate .deb archives from your CPAN package

=head1 VERSION

version 0.007

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Once the package is installed and you have setup the prereqs, you can run the following command inside your package folder:

     dzil dhmakeperl

Once this is done your package will be tested and deb file will be generated in the debuild folder for you.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a extension for the L<Dist::Zilla> App that adds a command dhmakeperl to your dzil package for compiling your perl modules into .deb packages. 

Before you install this package make sure that dh-make-perl is installed in your debianE<sol>ubuntu system. There are some additional app requirements that you might want to install for dh-make-perl to avoid annoying warnings from dh-make-perl.

     sudo apt-get install dh-make-perl
     sudo apt-get install apt-file
     sudo apt-file update

To make sure that your changelog and debian control file is included use plugins L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Control::Debian> and L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ChangelogFromGit::Debian> in your dist.ini
